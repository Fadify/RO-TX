## About The Project

[![RO:TX][RO:TX Screen shot]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884020479009099797/884038097665409094/unknown.png)
RO:TX is an amzing Lua script for roblox. We have already made textures for robux and path-tracing simulation. 
Softwares like roshade fails to perform ray-tracing. Roshade only adds overlays to the software named as roblox. Therefore messing up all the screenguis and core guis.
