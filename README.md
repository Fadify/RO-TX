## About The Project


RO:TX is an amzing Lua script for roblox. We have already made textures for robux and path-tracing simulation. 
Softwares like roshade fails to perform ray-tracing. Roshade only adds overlays to the software named as roblox. Therefore messing up all the screenguis and core guis. 
We are always improving our project. Other aim is to make roblox as realistic as possible.
